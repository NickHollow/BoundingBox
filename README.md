Leaflet app where the coordinates of several locations are reported back on the fly.  The current code updates the coordinates
onscreen on the fly.  The page has seven divs that report different attributes of the getBounds() attribute for the map object.
Very useful and very easy to use.  For more information on Leaflet, check out the documentation: http://leafletjs.com/reference.html



Update - 3/2016 - Updated basemap to OSM tile layer
